Assignment: 

Each movie is represented by an object, which consists of a title, a rating for how good the movie is from 1-5, and a boolean indicating whether you have watched the movie.
The assignment was to write the code for each function so that it will store and process the data and generate the stated output. 
The code requires conditionals, loops, functions, and objects to complete the project.
